##NBA Performance Feedback Model
In this project we will collaboratively provide feedback based on individual game statistics analyze using advanced Machine Learning methodologies to find how individuals perform in the NBA. Our statistics will incorporate transformer models, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and other tools acquired throughout the course, in addition to at least one new technology SQL that we haven’t covered together.

1. Take natural language query from
2. Translate (using code LLM) the natural language query from #1 into SQL command
3. Run the query from #2 against the db

#GRADIO FRONT-END
We want to build a Gradio front-end that:

Takes a natural language query from the user.
Translates it into an SQL query using Llama LLM.
Executes the SQL query against your database and shows the results.
I'll guide you in setting up this interface.

Overview of What We’ll Do
Install Required Libraries.
Set Up Environment Variables.
Write the Gradio Interface Code.
Run and Test the Gradio Interface.
