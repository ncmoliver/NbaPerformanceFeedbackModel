# NBA
In this project we will be refactoring code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. The NBA Performance Feedback Model is created and trained, a Gradio app to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. NBA Performance Feedback Model will provide feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance.
